## TOOLS and TECHNOLOGIES

1. In order to design the site, I mainly use bootstrap and bootstrap-icons, but in addition to that, a small css file (App.ccs) is used.
2. The site offers 2 display options, a Dark Mode and a Light Mode, and for that I used bootstrap.
3. In "React", useState, useEffect and useContext and Custom Hooks are used to build the website.
4. "Formik" is used to manage forms.
5. "Joi" is used for form fields validation.
6. "Axios" was used to handle http requests.
7. "React-Router-Dom" was used for routing and url options.
8. "Toastify" was used for various alerts.
9. Google fonts was used for fonts.
